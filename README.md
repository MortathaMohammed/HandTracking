# Hand Tracking and Gesture Recognition

This Python script uses the MediaPipe library to track hand movements and recognize gestures using a webcam or camera as input. It provides real-time feedback on finger positions and can recognize various hand gestures.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- MediaPipe

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe
```

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-tracking.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd hand-tracking
```

## Usage

1. Run the `hand_tracking.py` script:

```bash
python hand_tracking.py
```

2. The script will open your computer's camera and start tracking your hand.

3. The frame rate (FPS) will be displayed in the console.

4. Move your hand in front of the camera, and the script will track the position of your fingers and display the recognized gesture on the screen.

5. To exit the script, press the "Esc" key.

## Customization

You can customize the script by modifying the gesture recognition logic and appearance settings in the code. For example, you can change the colors used for drawing or define new gestures to recognize.

## Acknowledgments

This project is built upon the MediaPipe library, which provides hand tracking and drawing utilities. We would like to express our gratitude to the developers of MediaPipe for their contributions to the field of computer vision.
